Be of single aim. Have a legitimate and useful purpose, and devote yourself unreservedly to it.

Avoid exaegrations. The Truth is sufficient. Speak only words which are truthful and sincere.
James Allen

I strongly believe this  formula:  “TIME x EFFORT = SUCCESS”and trying to follow it.

When we think of ourselves compared to the universe, we are microscopically tiny little guys.

We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live; they travel far.

“Be the change that you wish to see in the world.”
